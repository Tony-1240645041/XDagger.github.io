Whitelist cleaning

Recently, as some pools in the whitelist are defunct and there has been no communication from their owners, we have decided to remove defunct pools from the whitelist in the following weeks. Pools that are no longer functioning will be removed. This ensures that the network will continue to function, and increase activity again with new interested people.

As always, please remember to monitor your miners and payouts. If you have not received any mining profits, it might be the case that the pool is defunct. You can check the status of pools at https://xdag.io/pools</content><author>

We want to ensure people that we continue working on being added to new exchanges, with the next releases of our software helping us reach that goal. We also want to remind you that XDAG is trading on four exchanges. Two of these exchanges cater to Chinese customers only.


  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  


Marketing

Recently, XDAG has been added on coingecko.com. Once XDAG reaches a higher volume on these exchanges, a price chart will be available.



Furthermore, the XDAG team has been in contact with exchanges listed on coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com. Hopefully these exchanges have a large enough interest to add XDAG trading pairs. Once any new information regarding this matter is available, we will share that as soon as possible.

We also want to thank you for your continued support. Mining continues to be a stronghold which spurs XDAG forward.

Giveaway
Our last giveaway goodies have been received by the winners. Thanks to Antonio (Facebook winner) who shared this image with us.



Development

Our developers have worked a lot this month. They have made more than 100 commits for review and testing, which means that the next XDAG release will continue to improve the network. It is very important to us that the XDAG software is improved upon each release.

If you want to follow our developers work, you can find it on GitHub.

Lastly, we would like to share our thanks again. Thank you to everyone for their continued support. And finally, many thanks to our great developers who continue to improve the XDAG software.</content><author>
